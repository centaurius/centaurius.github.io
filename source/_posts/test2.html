<p>Launched in 2015 as a go-to place for development junkies, productivity masters, people who love great music of all sorts, Centaurius Blog is the place to find a curated list of some of the hottest industry projects and information.  While young, this blog is finding its way across the globe with the help of people like you!  We breed positivity, post about some of the great things to hit the tech world today and we believe that everything should be accessible to the common user.  What are our other pillars?</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Tech and tips should be fun and accessible, and reviews should be done in light of the people who will consume the information.</li>
  <li>Music should examine aspects of culture and history, while still being clean and respectful.</li>
  <li>To provide a safe place for all to find things that interest them and make their lives fun! </li>
</ul>

<p>In case you’re like, holy crap, Centaurius Blog sound like it was made just for me, then let’s be BFFLs.  Down to tech? Simply subscribe to our email list and receive periodic updates about what’s going on in the world.</p>

<p>So who came up with this load of craziness anyway?</p>

<p>Glad you asked my newest internet pal.  Founded and currently based in Rochester, NY, Centaurius Blog is the product of Hamilton White.  All third person statements aside, I created this blog to be a cauldron where I could explore what was the newest and greatest pieces of tech today, share killer tunes and generally rock out from time to time.  </p>

<p>It all started while creating a website to host one of my hackathon projects in 2015.  I was using a template to market our newest creation, Plumber Person (a Pebble smartwatch app, see my github).  After completing the project and winning the hackathon, I got on the HTML bandwagon and have been riding by the seat of my pants ever since.</p>

<p>In addition to blogging, I am a Biomedical Engineering student, participate in collegiate crew (rowing), and try to find any spare day I can to not wake up at 4am!  Come join me on a journey of tech and cool music!</p>
