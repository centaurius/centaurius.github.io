<h1 class="section-heading">What Tangerines?</h1>

>The ones you can squeeze!

It was recently announced that for the past 5 years, an impromptu ceremony has developed for the losing team.  It all started in 2012, with Rutgers losing 13-to-10 against Virginia Tech in overtime.  As sophomore QB Nary Gova explains:

>"Well, all us Rutgers guys just got really angry at the score about the end of the second half.  So we called up to the private box and had 13 boxes of tangerines sent down to the locker room for immediately after the game.  We got there, and by that point the game was already lost.  But never fear, 'cause the tangerines were here!  Grabbing handful-by-handful, and making sure to give just a gentle squeeze, we lined up outside the Virginia Tech locker room and gave all hell as they exited.  Man the look on their face as their nice Italian suits were ruined with juice...whoo heeeee!"  

We also heard that Wim Tright, Rutgers senior famously added:
>"And this is for making us punt so God damn many times!"

All in all it seems, the little game stuck.  Now every time a Russel Bowl is played, extra tangerines are placed in the locker rooms, leading to lots of post game fun, and leaving something for the janitors to lick off the floor the next day.
